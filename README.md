# fungi-final-project-285
Final project for CSCI 285 on modeling the growth rates and decomposition of woody fibers by fungi using agent based modeling techniques.

Written in python 3 using the mesa agent based model visualization library. 

To install, clone the git repository. Then, create a python virtual environment using venv in the local repo, activate the environment, and install the requirements from the requirements.txt with pip. The model can be run by running the python file named run.py.

The model dependencies can also be installed and run using anaconda, but I found that using a virtual environment with pip avoided some rare issues with the PATH environmental variable on windows machines.
